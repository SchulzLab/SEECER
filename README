Requirements:
1. JellyFish
2. SeqAn

Installation:
1. Compile JellyFish
cd jellyfish-1.1.4/
./configure
make

2. Compile SEECER:
cd SEECER 
./configure
make

3. Usage:
We provide 2 test datasets:

 * Large dataset from SRR027877 from www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRX011546 (Illumina
   sequencing of Human CD4 T cells RNA-Seq paired-end library)
    - Run using only Read 1
   ./bin/run_seecer.sh testdata/SRR027877-p1.fasta	      
    - Run with two pairs of all reads
   ./bin/run_seecer.sh testdata/SRR027877-p1.fasta testdata/SRR027877-p2.fasta

 * Small dataset (first 25000 pairs of the large dataset)
   ./bin/run_seecer.sh   testdata/SRR027877-small-p1.fastq testdata/SRR027877-small-p2.fastq


   The corrected reads are store in the files *_corrected.fa
